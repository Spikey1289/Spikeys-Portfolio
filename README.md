# Challenge-2 PORTFOLIO README

## Intoduction
This is the README for the Second Challenge of my coding bootcamp. This repository contains a website I built myself of my coding portfolio. This challenge was to see if I could make a website from scratch to match certain perameters, as well as teach me how to make a rudementary portfolio for my future use.

## Things Learned
Through this challenge, I was able to learn how to create a website from scratch, modifying it to be responsive to the user's device screen size, create interactive links and images, and I both learned how to and create(d) a portfolio of past works
